# 📋 Project Brief: PPTX Generator Tool

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Project Name:** PPTX Generator  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-11-15  
**Author:** Jean-Louis GUENEGO

### Objective

Develop a command-line tool that automatically generates a Microsoft PowerPoint (.pptx) presentation from a structured `slides/` directory. The directory contains YAML files (one per slide) generated by the existing `xxxSlides` command, each defining slide metadata, content, and assets. The tool must produce a professional, printable, and presentation-ready PPTX file, adhering to the conventions outlined in `AGENTS.md`.

### Scope

- **Input:** The `slides/` directory with subdirectories per chapter (e.g., `slides/01-introduction/`), each containing YAML files (e.g., `01-01-cover.yaml`).
- **Output:** A single `.pptx` file (e.g., `presentation.pptx`) at the project root, with slides ordered by chapter and slide ID.
- **Key Features:**
  - Parse YAML files to extract slide data (title, type, bullets, key message, illustration prompt, speaker notes).
  - Generate PPTX slides with appropriate layouts (e.g., title slide for cover, bullet list for content, table of contents for TOC).
  - Embed or generate visuals based on illustration prompts (e.g., integrate AI-generated images or placeholders).
  - Include speaker notes in the PPTX notes section.
  - Support for 18 slides per chapter, with proper sequencing.
- **Non-Scope:** No editing of YAML files, no integration with external APIs for real-time image generation (use placeholders or pre-generated assets), no advanced animations or themes beyond standard PPTX defaults.

### Stakeholders

- **Primary User:** Training content creators using the `make-pptx` workflow.
- **Technical Lead:** Developer responsible for implementation.
- **Business Owner:** JLG Consulting (Jean-Louis Guénégo).

### Constraints

- **Technology Stack:** TypeScript with bun (recommended for PPTX manipulation via `pptxgenjs` library).
- **Dependencies:** Must be compatible with existing YAML structure from `AGENTS.md`.
- **Timeline:** Phase 1: Design and specs (current); Phase 2: Implementation (TBD).
- **Assumptions:** YAML files are valid and complete; illustrations are handled via prompts (e.g., generate or link to images in a separate `assets/` folder).

### Success Criteria

- Tool generates a PPTX with all slides from `slides/` directory.
- Output is visually coherent, with correct slide types and content.
- Command-line interface: e.g., `bun run pptx-generator.ts --output presentation.pptx`.
- Error handling for missing files or invalid YAML.

### Next Steps

- Refine detailed specs in subsequent documents (e.g., `01-technical-specs.md`, `02-ui-specs.md`).
- Prototype a sample PPTX generation for one chapter.
- Discuss integration with existing `xxxSlides` workflow.
